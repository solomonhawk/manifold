/**
 * A hook for getting and setting URL Search Parameters with React Router.
 *
 * NOTE: React Router v6 has a built-in hook for this, but it has an issue with
 * multiple updates.
 *
 * With React's own `useState` hook, updater functions are passed the CURRENT
 * value. For example:
 * ```ts
 * const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 * const incrementBy2 = () => {
 *    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)
 *    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)
 * }
 * ```
 * Calling `incrementBy2` will increment `count` by 2: the second call to
 * `setCount` will use the updated value from the first call.
 *
 * React Router's own `useSearchParams` hook does not have this behavior: it
 * uses outdated values when multiple updates occur in a row. This inhibits
 * the ability independently update multiple search params in a single render
 * cycle.
